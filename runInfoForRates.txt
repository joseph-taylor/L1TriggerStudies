For each run I have used rates.cxx on,
these are the numbers I have used for normalisation

run 259721:
numBunchCollding = 517
runLuminosity = 0.15 *(10^34)

run 269224:
numBunchColliding = 2
runLuminosity = 0.00037 *(10^34)

run 271336
numBunchColliding = 8
runLuminosity = 0.0025 *(10^34)

run 271306
numBunchColliding = 8
runLuminosity = 0.0033 *(10^34)

run 272022
numBunchColliding = 49 
runLuminosity = 0.014 *(10^34)
